# EP website

Objective of this project was to create a small representative mobile friendly website giving priority to SEO. 
To achieve this objective I decided to use [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) as a static site generator and headless [Cockpit CMS](https://getcockpit.com/) to create custom API endpoint for content delivery via [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) framework allowed to create a decent responsive website design.
